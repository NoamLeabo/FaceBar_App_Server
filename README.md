WorkFlow:

We started by implementing the basic MVC server that we saw in the lecture.

We made a brief implementation of all functions that the servers needs to have.

Then we started implementing all the different functions according to the given routes.

We added functions for adding/deleting friends and started to improve all implementations.

We checked that the implementation has all required functions and works well either with android and the web.

We the improved and finished the last small details to finish.
